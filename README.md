# Workout_helper
Designed to help me track my new rotational workout schedule, created out of the need to beat my current progression plateau.

## Project Overview
The system is comprised of the following components:
- Database (stores all exercise details)
- Kotlin mobile app
	- query calling backend
	- workout printing frontend

## Technologies Used
- Antigravity
- Supabase
	- Database
	- SQL Editor
	- Authentication
- Kotlin

## Note
I originally planned to use the Google Sheets API since that's where I've historically stored all of my workout data, but I kept getting these awesome email notifications from ant.wilson/Supabase that the project associated with my Gleep Corral webapp would be paused and eventually deleted because it didn't get sufficient activity - my solution? use another service under that project to boost project resource usage.
